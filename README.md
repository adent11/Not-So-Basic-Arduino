## Hello Functions

In this assignment I learned how to use functions by writing a code to rotate a servo to a different angle depending on how close something is to the ultrasonic sensor. In it I used one function to return the distance and another to move the servo accordingly. <br/>

One useful thing I learned from this was how using functions can make your life easier by allowing you to reuse code.

## NewPing()

For this assignment I used the NewPing library to get the distance instead of my own function. I made it so the distance was printed on the serial monitor in centimeters and an LED brightened or dimmed depending on far an obstruction was from the sensor. <br/>

I had fun with this assignment because I made something where your physical action had an effect on the light.
